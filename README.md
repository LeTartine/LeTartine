Hi, Iâ€™m @LeTartine
Currently working in Cybersecurity, I'm always thirsty for new stuff and know-how
Dev has always been a weak spot of mine, but analysis is the stronger side of my skillset
For now this GitHub's a bit empty, but I'll be working on filling it with small (and large?) projects

If you'd like to reach out to me, feel free to mail at 29a2@6d65.eu. 

Cheers!
